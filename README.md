# capturethatimage
Supybot plugin to play a game with image links.

This needs to be finished up, its mostly all there but not very elegantly so.

The idea is to send a bot command @cti followed by an image link and it starts a game where users /msg the bot to offer up (funny) captions for the image, after a time voting begins where users who entered captions vote on which caption they liked best (can't vote on your own) and after all users have voted a winner is decalred.

The idea is from an old web-based game called Get The Picture. It should give a spin on users who post silly images into channels, turning it into a fun game.

If anyone wants to help finish this, or even just completely redo the idea, feel free. I am not sure right now when I will get around to it.

That is, if you want to completely re-write this and make a working version, you don't need to worry about any liscensing or credit, if you are going to release it under similar terms and will let me know where I can find your code.
